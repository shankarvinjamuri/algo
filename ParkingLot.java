    /*
     * Design a parking lot using object-oriented principles.
     * 
     * Goals:
     * Your solution should be in Python or Node.js - if you would like to use
     * another language, please let the interviewer know.
     * The solution should be an object oriented solution.
     ** Objective is to display your best code design, this doesnâ€™t need to be 100%
     * functional. **
     * 
     * Assumptions:
     * The parking lot can hold motorcycles, cars and vans
     * The parking lot has small spots, medium spots and large spots.
     * A motorcycle can park in any spot.
     * A car can park in a medium spot, or a large spot.
     * A van can park only in a large spot.
     * 
     * Functionality needed:
     * Ability to add vehicles by type. Once added it should deduct accordingly from
     * total slots.
     * Ability to tell us how many spots are remaining by vehicle type or by all
     * types.
     * Ability to tell us if the lot is full.
